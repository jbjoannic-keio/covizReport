# Computer Visualization reports
## Report 3 - 2D Scalar Field - 01/05
- the program can be found [here](./exec/rep3.cpp)
- it computes the differences between two images and save results in the images folder
## Report 4 - MS+AD - 08/05
- the program can be found [here](./exec/rep4.cpp)
- the input grid and alpha can be replaced [here](exec/rep4.cpp#L335), the program run with fixed size arrays, but it is scalable so just some modifications should be applied to work on every size of array
- it computes and draw topological boundaries with the marching squares method and a linear interpolation, and saves the results into the [images folder](/images/4/results/)
## Report 8 - m-D Data Analysis - 8/06
- the notebook can be found [here](./exec/rep8.ipynb)
- the input data dile must be changed [here](exec/rep8.ipynb)
- it computes the PCP and scatter plot matrix for this dataset
